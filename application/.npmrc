# NPM Configuration File
# ---------------------

# 1. Where to download from
# 2. How to handle network issues
# 3. Caching preferences

# Use official npm registry
# (ensures we get verified packages)
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Network retry settings
# - Attempts: 5 times
# - Backoff: Doubles each retry
# - Timeout: 10-60 seconds
# Important for CI/CD and unreliable networks
