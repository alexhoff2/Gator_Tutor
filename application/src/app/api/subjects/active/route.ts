 * Active Subjects Route ðŸ“š

 * Handles GET /api/subjects/active
 * Returns only subjects that have tutors teaching them
 * 
 * Why two exports at the top?
 * ---------------------------
 * Next.js caching controls:
 * - dynamic: "force-dynamic"    â†’ Don't cache this route at build time
 * - fetchCache: "force-no-store" â†’ Don't cache responses in the browser
 * 
 * Why? Because tutor availability changes frequently!
